[{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"We made reservations at Tiffins on a Saturday night for dinner.  The restaurant  has three dinning rooms and is very spacious so we didn't have wait long for our table. During the short walk to our table we got a brief description of the room we would be dining in. We dined in the Grand Gallery which was very decorative with beautifully designed lantern animals on the wall that followed an animal\/planet conservation theme.\n\nWe were then greeted by our server who gave us a rundown of the menu. I had made sure to mention to her that it was our second time dinning at Tiffins, just in case there were any changes made from our previous visit. (We liked it that much we had to come for a second visit). She informed us that there had been a few changes to the menu such as replacing the Duo of Lamb with the Duo of Venison and switching out the Grouper for a Swordfish.\n\nAfter thinking long and hard about the menu, we finally decided on two entrees: The Pomegranate -lacquered chicken and the Seared Hokkaido Scallops.  As we waited for the food to come out, the server brought out some complimentary bread for us to snack on. It was Pomegranate Focaccia bread, and let me tell you, it was very unique and delicious. It was not too fluffy, but a slightly more dense type of bread. It also was also lightly glazed with a molasses sauce which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to that, there was a dipping sauce made of molasses, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and hints of pomegranate which gave it the right amount of tanginess. The server had told us to use it sparingly because a little went a long way. But It was so delicious! We even got seconds on the bread.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was equally as delicious.  The food was plated beautifully and the taste was on point.  The chicken was nicely flavored and moist. It pretty much fell off the bone and went great with the Sweet Potato Pap. The Thumbelina carrots were also super cute and yummy.  The Fennel salad was a great compliment to all the flavors and textures of the dish.  I tried a piece of the scallops and they were so good! We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts which came in a pretty decently sized considering it was a side.  There were bits of bacon pieces in the Brussels which made it even better!\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner filled with great food, great service and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all very worth it. Located right outside of the new Pandora attraction. It's perfect if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Animal Kingdom.","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"Tiffins is an upscale restaurant located in the middle of Disney's Animal Kingdom.  We were excited to eat here before trying to catch the Rivers of Light show.  \n\nOur dinner reservation was at 5:40 since we were trying to catch the 8:45 show. Unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes late due to the bus running late.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, each room is a different art gallery dedicated to conservation.\n\nI figured that still arriving at 6 would be plenty of time for the show but for some reason the hostess had us wait.  This was strange since it was very empty.  15 minutes later we were seated.  \n\nHaving been on safari in Africa I was excited by the menu as it had a lot of exotic meats.  We started with the charcuterie platter as a starter. I went with the duo of venison which had a venison filet and boerewors (South African sausage).  My wife went with the SA lobster enhancement and the Gobi cauliflower.\n\nI would say i was a little disappointed by the platter and my entree.  The starter was very small and the vension and sausage were not bad but served cold.  I will say that the lobster was amazing and so was the Gobi.\n\nI think the worst part of the restaurant has to be the service.  From the lackadasical hostess to the waiter which took FOREVER for dinner service unbelievably we did not make the 8:45 show.  On top of that it was one of our pricier meals that weekend.  \n\nOverall this place is definitely nice and the food isn't bad.  I think the exorbitantly long service and price make it just Ok for me.","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"My family and I ate at Tiffins in Disney's Animal Kingdom this afternoon. The place is beautiful and thoroughly relaxing, the service was excellent. We also liked the food as well. It's a good place to go for a nice meal. I would still prefer Jiko but this was a satisfying choice.","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"When you go to Disney World's parks, you expect Mickey Pretzels, Ice Cream Bars, and Chicken Tenders. What you don't expect, is high end African fusion cuisine in the middle of Animal Kingdom.\n\nI dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.\n\nI ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. \n\nThe first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.\n\nThe main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!\n\nFinally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.\n\nThe sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you receive a postcard collectible of an original drawing tributed to the AK. I love this restaurant, I love the food, and I love the service. Do yourself a favor and find some time to escape the jungle of the theme park and enjoy a fantastic meal at Tiffin's.","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"This review is for the lounge area, as we did not eat in the restaurant.

I can say this was one of the best meals that I have ever had. Each dish was spectacular in taste, execution, and presentation. The crowning jewel of the evening was the impeccable service. \nWe have eaten lunch and dinner here before. Also, stopped in to the bar for drinks and appetizers. The Grilled Octopus has become my newest food crave. It is sous-vide cooked and then grilled to give it a smoky flavor. The texture is amazing. Don't expect to be eating a piece of rubber, but a piece of heaven.","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"0BGoel6on7yGvojzOqOEAQ","review_body":"This restaurant is inside of Disney's Animal Kingdom park.  It is very pricey and if you can afford to eat here, absolutely enjoy.  We had the 2 for $28 lunch special and the items (beef tamale, octopus, beef short ribs and causa) were all very delicious.  These are served tapas size with a side of rice which lacked all flavoring (surprising since everything else was very flavorful).  I doused everything with chimchurri sauce and I devoured everything.  The only thing I didn't like was the bread that they serve.  It was weird.

Just a 5 minute drive from Harvard Square, it was cozy and informal, and reminded me of Italian restaurants in smaller towns and cities there, such and Parma. \n\nThe owner actually came over, took our order, and served us. That was a nice treat. He's from Napoli, and he was extremely accommodating. I spotted a man at a table on the other side of the room eating what turned out to be a squid-ink pasta with seafood. We managed to snag the very last one available after the owner rushed over to put the order in. \n\nWe had an excellent cheese, prosciutto and figs anti-paste; squid-ink pasta; and hanger steak with Brussels sprouts and potatoes. A great added thing was they split the pasta and steak into two small dishes for us. For dessert with had chocolate tort with hazelnut gelato, and a tiramisu. \n\nSquid ink seafood pasta with shrimps was the best. Hanger steak was very good. The ambience was laid back and comfy. \n\nOverall, an authentic Italian eatery without any pretentiousness whatsoever. A gem, just as it was said to be. We'll be returning soon. But please don't go! Or don't tell too many folks if you do. A gem like this deserves to remain half secret. ;)","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"2AORsy2N2kbFX91EXm10Qg","review_body":"I had high expectations based on past reviews. I was in town for business from CA. \n\nAtmosphere was great. But chairs are uncomfortable--very hard. I asked for a table where I'd have room to work, but the larger table was for 4 and I was a party of just 1. So my request was denied. However, the larger table was still empty when I left. And part way through the evening they opened a larger room that had lots of larger tables. \n\nThe wine recommendation was good. However, in spite of the anchovies and shaved Parmesan cheese, the Caesar salad was tasteless. I added some lemon, salt, pepper and olive oil which made it ok. The bread was very disappointing. Typical Italian restaurant bread is crusty, hot and cut thick. This was the total opposite--cold and like pieces of a packaged loaf! \n\nMy main course, scialatiella, pasta with mixed seafood with cherry tomatoes was also just OK. The 3 clams and 3 mussels were tiny, the shrimp had been cut in small pieces and I never found any of the calamari.","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"2AORsy2N2kbFX91EXm10Qg","review_body":"Awesome place in the middle of random location.   \n\nGet the truffle pizza and grilled calamari if available. Entrees are not that exciting but appetizers and pizzas rock so stick to those.  Definitely fair prices on the wine menu. \n\nWish the bread basket was better quality but if you order pizzas than you don't need it.

This place is no longer my all-time favorite pizza. I prefer Frank Pepe's now (I gave them a 5-star rating). \n\n-------------------------------\n\nI'm astonished that this pizza place has been around for at least 8 years and I'm just now finding out about it! Even on Yelp. Grand Gusto shows up at #28 on a query for \"Cambridge Pizza.\"\n\nI had a Funghi Pizza since I don't eat meat, and it was mesmerizing. That was the worlds best crust and nicely Charred. \n\nThe pizzas were baked in a hot wood (?) oven I suppose. It definitely was NOT a Conventional oven but an old fashioned one.","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"2AORsy2N2kbFX91EXm10Qg","review_body":"Run, don't walk to Gran Gusto.  It is a neighborhood gem in every sense of the word. We have dined here maybe six times and have never been disappointed. I love Italian restaurants that build their menu around seafood and Gran Gusto does this well.  There are TWO calamari appetizers, for example: grilled or fried.  There are several pasta dishes featuring seafood, but my favorite is the Scialatelli which features homemade pasta tossed in a light garlic, white wine sauce with muscles, baby clams, calamari, and shrimp.  Delicioso! Also excellent is the Hanger Steak, marinated and broiled as well as the daily specials on this occasion, the Dover Sole.  Wines are attractively priced, too.  \n\nFor a potentially less expensive alternative, Gran Gusto's pizza selection is a terrific choice. The tomato pies are thin and nicely crusty with many attractive toppings.\n\nFor dessert, there is always the ubiquitous Tiramisu which is devilishly chocolatey, or the Ricotta Pie, or the Gelato.  \n\nMany customers were overhead speaking Italian ( I am of that wonderful heritage), and the owners (brothers from Naples) are constantly keeping tabs on the kitchen and the customer happiness quotient.\n\nOh. Did I tell you about the bread? The amazing sour dough bread tastes like it just came out of the oven; You cannot ask for more in a restaurant.  And yes the coffee (cappuccino was excellent too).","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"2ILe62hVJfiZEOcKxFYKDA","review_body":"Great beers, great talks.

We were seated and waited for quite a long time to put our order in, which would be fine, the company was good and we were visiting.  The problem occurred after we had been sitting for 1 hour and 20 minutes and still had no food in front of us.  Luckily we did not have small children with us.  \n\nIt was 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived.  In that time we had to ask for water and coffee every time, our server came by voluntarily one time and when I asked for some bread for our son we were brought biscuits that were \"on the house\". I understand that it was a special occasion, but the restaurant was only half full and of those tables I would guess that most had reservations, so they knew what they were getting in to for the day.\n\nWhen our food finally did arrive half of it came  a full 5 minutes after the first half.  The one order of steak and egg was both cold and missing the egg.  We sent it back, after 5 minutes it returned not re-fired but simply re-heated with an egg thrown on top, so that the steak was then over cooked.\n\nI am so sad to have to remove bluehour from our list of favorites, or in fact choices, I'm afraid the other restaurants in the chain will likely fall off the list as well.","product_category":"French"},{"product_id":"3cJQN_dv1PysB7jw_PQozg","review_body":"Blue Hour is one of those rare restaurants where I can say that I have never had a bad meal.

As someone who is actually from France, I can attest to the fact that good service and food do not necessarily have to  translate into obsequious, overpriced fare.

They made up for it by bringing us complimentary glasses of sparking rose.  There's a fondue dish that's supposed to be amazing on their bar menu-we wanted it as an appetizer, and we were told that the chef doesn't serve any of the bar menu in the main part of the restaurant....what?

We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy.

I've been here for brunch quite a few times recently and maybe it's the brunch service that pulling down the rating for me.  \n\nFood 4\/5: Still pretty solid compared to other restaurants I dine at.  Love the dinners here, but brunch is starting to get slightly less exciting.  Maybe it's the somewhat limited selection on the menu.  Espresso is weak.   Tried the duck fat fried donuts that are all the hype right now, both the bacon topped \"When Sticky Pigs Fly\" and the honey hazelnut \"Nutty Duckers\".  Both were okay.  Warm, freshly made, but maybe too much hype.  To be honest, I was underwhelmed.  The donuts were rather flavourless and the toppings didn't add quite enough punch.\n\nValue 3\/5: Some of the brunch portions are on the smaller side.  \n\nAtmosphere 5\/5: Always bustling, a fun place to be.\n\nService 3\/5: Friendly, but becoming consistently on the slow side.

Was pleased to find it full of veggies and full of great flavor.","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"5Yjlkds0PtfGhiNPMWIRIw","review_body":"My family has been coming to this restaurant for about 9 years now.\nWe absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone, and bring all our guests here. We even had Beau Thai cater my sons graduation party - and the party guests raved about the food.\n\nThe food itself can sometimes be standard thai food, but there are two key standouts that we personally must get here: \n1. The crab puffs on the appetizers menu. Almost every other thai restaurant has these, but the difference here is that these are not flat wontons that have a tiny bit of stuffing inside them. These are genuine PUFFS and are very full. When I order these at other restaurants, I'm always disappointed by the amount of fried empty wonton I have to tear away so that I can get a bite with some stuffing in it. Why would I want to eat just straight fried wonton wrapper? Pointless. Beau Thai makes these a really wonderful way - they are full, they are delicious, not too crabby tasting-but clearly made with crab, and (I'm pretty sure) you get 8 to an order. It's a great deal for the price.  They also have peas in them, which I find delightful, my non-pea-loving son does not. I like the added flavor and the little bit of texture it brings. They aren't overwhelming so even though my son doesn't like peas, he still LOVES these crab puffs.\n\n2. Peanut chicken. I don't actually know if that's even the name, but that's what we've been calling it for almost a decade. Regardless of what you call it, t's REALLY good stuff. It's this huge bowl full of chicken swimming in peanut sauce. It's almost a soup, but served over rice and oh-so-good. There's nobody in Portland that serves this in the same way (that we have ever heard of). We almost always order a separate dish of this to go home with us - it's even better the next day (I like it served in a wrap with lettuce- mmmmm!). \n\n**the chicken satay is also a favorite, but it's really just chicken and peanut sauce (see number 2 above). \n\nThe service here can NOT be beat. We just adore the owner and her staff. If you call the order in, it will be ready quickly, and if you're in a hurry but eating there-just let her know and she will get your food to you in a flash. If you don't special request the speedy service, it's pretty normal wait time if you have a group-almost no wait time if there's just two of you, but you can definitely tell that the food is made fresh. \n\nThe restaurant itself is wonderful. Great atmosphere, always very clean, good location, lots of seating. My friends and I love that they have these massive booths for groups, I think they probably fit 8-10 easily and have some wonderful privacy to them. Every time I'm there with a group, we feel like we're in a private room.\n\nParking is the only issue. If you don't mind walking, just head down a couple blocks to 18th or so and you'll find lots. Parking on 21st is always a mess though and isn't a blight on the restaurant itself.\n\nI highly recommend Beau Thai - locally owned,  authentic thai owner, perfect ambience, and wonderful food at reasonable prices all make for a great experience.","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"5Yjlkds0PtfGhiNPMWIRIw","review_body":"Why do I keep coming back? I guess it's because I love Thai food (even painfully boring Thai food) and I'm lazy (this is my 'hood). I would rate Beau Thai one star, but it gets two for the cutesy, creative name and the fact that I keep coming back for mediocrity.\n\nI ALWAYS order the Pad Thai and I'm ALWAYS disappointed. It just lacks flavor. It does come with peanut sauce and that's not always a given with Pad Thai, so I guess that detail helps Beau Thai keep its two stars. But don't be lazy like me. You can do so much better for Thai.","product_category":"Restaurants"},{"product_id":"5Yjlkds0PtfGhiNPMWIRIw","review_body":"I tried to give this place another chance.

A king-sized loaf of white bread can be a buck or even $0.50 on sale.

Fruits and vegetables are fresh.  Staffing\/checkout is good considering how many people go there on a Saturday.  Employees are helpful and friendly.  The secret to their low prices is volume, and they stock continuously during the day.  The down side is that it's usually crowded, hard to find a parking space in the huge lot, and stockers are taking up space for carts.  When the (non-unionized) employees shut the operation down to support their former and current CEO Artie T, I shop at other places (not crossing a picket line), and it made me realize that the value of MB is undeniable.","product_category":"Food"},{"product_id":"AcWbIflEot9KREPF4Wl6Bg","review_body":"Market Basket on a weekend is my own personal hell. It's as though everybody in the city decides to shop here at the exact same time, filling the place so thoroughly that were a fire to happen we would all die instantly.\n\nOn off-hours (weekday mornings especially) things aren't so bad and it transforms into a weirdly laid out supermarket with good prices and some interesting specialty items.","product_category":"Food"},{"product_id":"AcWbIflEot9KREPF4Wl6Bg","review_body":"Shopping at Market Basket could be turned into a professional sport.  And I say professional because I know some people just aren't up to the challenge.  Amateurs.  \n\nLike a good athlete it's wise to prepare before entering into the match.  Like an English Channel swimmer or a wrestler you may want to grease yourself up so you can squeeze through the crowded aisles with more ease.  \n\nTake a tip from the pros and think about doing some strength training so that you can do your shopping with baskets instead of a cart.  This will allow you greater mobility in getting around those tight corners and narrow passages between everyone else's carts.  \n\nAll good athletes know that timing plays a large part of the game.  For me, I've found that 4:45 on the weekdays works like a charm.  I rarely have to wait in line at checkout even when I have more than 12 things. (You'll notice that hardly anyone comes here for light shopping.  Carts are usually packed to an unsafe capacity.  So take advantage of the 12 items or less cashiers when you can.)  Avoid weekends here if you can, especially in the afternoon.\n\nThe thing that surprised me most about Market Basket was the high quality of their meats and produce.  Having just moved to this area after being around the corner from both TJ and WF I figured I was going to miss the quality of their products.  Surprisingly, I've become quite enamored with the wide range of selections they have here of their cuts of meat and both fresh fruits and veg.  Not to mention that you're saving a mint every time you shop here.\n\nSome people might want to pay the extra bucks for the ambiance and pleasant smells of a Whole Foods.  I'm no longer that guy.  Market Basket has changed me.  I come out of here with the thrill of victory in my heart like I've just led my troops to win a lynch-pin battle.  \n\nYou can do it too.  Take a deep breath, plunge in, and keep your focus.  Remain calm and don't let your competitors rattle you.  Be smart and have a game plan.  You will be rewarded.","product_category":"Food"},{"product_id":"AcWbIflEot9KREPF4Wl6Bg","review_body":"Bottom line:  at least 15 - 20% cheaper than Shaw's\/Star, even better for many things.\r\n\r\nThere are nicer Market Baskets in the 'burbs.

When the TV movie is made telling the story of Arthur T., I want to have a cameo as a customer.  :)\n\nUpdate 12\/21\/2013: Market Basket does not earn 100% marks because their new plastic carry bags are tissue paper thin although they look the same as the old ones.  When single-bagged, these new shopping bags are so thin, a soft styrofoam meat package can rub through it.  They cannot withstand pressure or rubbing.\n\nMarket Basket has no web site, no receipt survey, and does not actively seek customer feedback.  If Yancy-F-127 haphazardly crushes your eggs and makes a messy soup in the bottom of your shopping bag each time, while Aurelia-G-186 treats your eggs as carefully as if they are her own, the managers are not aware of who are their best, and who are their worst, cashiers.  The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. \n\nOriginal:\n\nThis is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a \"everyday-low-price\" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.\n\nFor people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.\n\nShoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.","product_category":"Food"},{"product_id":"BJXadWOLyGXzly7Iqx4W_g","review_body":"I have had dinner from El Potro 3 times since they have opened.

The appetizer came before our beers - the first indication the service and kitchen weren't on the same page. They were out of not one but two different beers I ordered. They were nice and tried to offer two beers they did have on tap as samples, but they were completely different from the wheat beers I had ordered (and one was actually a cider).

Great drink. It tasted very fresh and like they spiced it themselves (rather than using some kind of purchased mix). You could see the fresh black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (which added a nice heat) floating in the drink. This was probably my favorite part of the experience. \n\nMy wife got the local beer flight, but they were out of a couple of beers, so they substituted others that were not local. No prob here: all of the beers were good. They have a decent selection of beers to choose from, too. \n\nFor my meal, I got the cobb salad, which was good.

We didnt complain nor brought any attention about it. When we got those dishes half was missing from each and took alittle additional time to get. \nThe chicken with garlic shrimp lacked flavor. Not by alittle but by alot. I was hoping to taste garlic but we couldnt at all. The sauce was watery and lacked any consistency on what i would expect a sauce to be. We had 3 little ramekins of that garlic sauce and put it on everything. We both feel kinda queezie and now think those were bad. I didnt think of it at the time but the consistency of that garlic stuff was more on the thicker side (possible built up slimyness). thinking maybe it was in that bar fridge for too long.

They have 5 space heaters going on in the petite dining area which stirred me into trying to find a central heating system. I saw no vents nor baseboards. Is that even legal!? You can rent out a space with no heat?\n\nAnyways, this joint has become my go to for Thai food in Quincy. I love their spring rolls cuz it comes hot burning hot and not greasy at all! A-OK on the Pad Thai, good texture and good tasting sauce. If it was a tad less sweet, it would've been perfect. I love their curry cuz it freakingly tastes like curry!\n\nAs for the service, the jack of all trades did a fine job for considering everything she was handling. Phone, pack take out, service dining room and took care of take out customers. She was basically doing everything except the cooking and delivery! Takeout\/Delivery orders were super busy. With all that going on, she was able to clear our table between courses and gave us clean dishes for dinner. On top of that, she came by to check if dinner was OK!\n\nP.S.

Annnd the service didn't change at all. Our waitress actually made a face at us while ordering (talk about super rude). There literally wasn't anyone else in the small joint. It seems more like a take out place than anything else. And for one coming from Boston, it really wasn't that good (but we went because there was parking...There wasn't, we looked for the parking place that people said they had and couldn't find it...Maybe we didn't try hard enough? I don't know). Anyway, really disapointing.\n\nIn terms of the food, I ordered the coconut thai chicken soup which was sweet. Actually sweet. So for me, it wasn't that good at all (not a lot of veggies but meh, for $3.50, I'm not going to make that big a stink). Also to be honest, I felt like the texture of my chicken was off, I don't say this often but it was almost like rubber, so that weirded me out. My sister got the chicken stir-fried dish with rice noodles that was actually pretty spicy and tasted good. This dish reflected what was said on yelp. My cousin's dish was also good, but not awesome so in the end it was the chicken stir-fried that was the best of all. Real bummer that out service was so lously and rude. No smiles, no nothing and very short of an eye roll from our waitress.

The salmon itself wasn't spiced\/seasoned at all, so thank goodness for that slice of lemon.

The atmosphere is great - dim lights, cool chandeliers, and lots of wood. The staff was kind and attentive, as well.\n\nThe menu is vast, but we opted for a whole rack of ribs (which comes with 2 sides) for $28. The food came out relatively fast, which is both wonderful and worrisome.\n\nThe ribs were hit-or-miss. Some were a bit dry, while others fell off the bone. The seasoning was mildly spicy and the BBQ sauce was just sweet enough.\n\nFor the 2 sides, we went with some mashed potatoes and 4-cheese macaroni. The sides were smaller than anticipated (about the size of my fist - which isn't much). Covered in delicious gravy, the mashed potatoes tasted like mother's. As for the 4-cheese macaroni? Eh. The crumble on top was epic, but the mac (sadly) lacked flavor! I had to add some salt, which is weird for me.\n\nAt the end, we were comfortably full, and we both eat a lot, normally. \n\n\nPros: Vibe, options, priced fairly, great spices, wet-naps for your nasty post-ribs face\n\nCons: Hit-or-miss food, small-ish sides","product_category":"Pubs"},{"product_id":"L9q__oKXL5YW29-Lsp5rbw","review_body":"Steak was cooked perfect service was amazing the greens were very tasting clean and friendly I order a ipa witch was amazing fun nice chill place.","product_category":"Pubs"},{"product_id":"L9q__oKXL5YW29-Lsp5rbw","review_body":"This review is only for the late night happy hour.\n\nThe price is reasonable... $7 for fried mac and cheese, bbq pork sandwich with chips... although, that night they had run out of the bbq pork and offered the bbq brisket instead.

Score! We made the order through Yelp at 1:05am last night, thinking we'll have some awesome food to eat! We called to make sure that they received the order and was, indeed, delivering it. They told us 40 minutes. This was at 1:10am. \n\n2AM - No food. We call and they tell us that the guy left half an hour ago and should be there any minute. We call the third party ordering system 15 minutes later (2:15am) and ask them where's our order. We're starving. We haven't eaten real food (only plane snacks) since noon west coast time, since we've been on the plane the whole time, we were just hungry. They tell us to keep waiting. Our food finally shows up at 2:38am. They apologized and said it was very busy.\n\nFood:\nYou'd think that because we were so hungry, we'd just think the food was delicious all around, right? No. It was not. The food was barely warm, and mostly closer to room temperature. We ordered the Taiwan Style Wonton Soup - the soup was flavorless, the noodles were mushy, but the wontons had decent flavor to them. The soup tasted like a watered down version of how the soup should be. We also got the beef fried rice, which was fine for fried rice. We also got the Panfried Pork Buns Shanghai Style, which was cold by the time we got it, so it was pretty gross. I can't speak to how it might taste when it's warm.\n\nI can't say that I can really update this review because I don't live in the area, but it did suck to hope for good food at the end of the night after a long flight only to be disappointed with a cold and flavorless meal.

I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. \n\nThe okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! \n\nThe omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! \n\nI also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. \n\nAll in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices! The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water. However, it's one of the few places that serve okonomiyaki in Vancouver so it would still be worth a visit.","product_category":"Sandwiches"},{"product_id":"NensKn1MSVU_rm-1Y6WlFA","review_body":"This was a convenient breakfast stop prior to entering the train station which is conveniently across the street.  Service was friendly and prompt. Black tea was made and served in a French press and was good.  Fried eggs were ordered 'over easy' and were cooked more medium. Also, the pan or surface used to fry the eggs left a brown crunchy crust on the eggs.  So, over easy eggs here crunched a bit. \nToast option was limited to only brown and  came with only a single butter pack - not enough for two pieces of toast. \nThe wash room was clean but children's high chairs are stored in the washroom adjacent the toilet which seems not ideal. \nIt was overall okay for breakfast.","product_category":"Sandwiches"},{"product_id":"NensKn1MSVU_rm-1Y6WlFA","review_body":"Quaint little place at Broadway & Cambie. Been here twice. First time, their tasty sukiyaki beef bowl left me wanting more. On the next visit a week later, the menus had changed and they no longer had the beef bowl. So I tried their sukiyaki beef rice burgers.\n\nTheir sukiyaki beef reminds me of MOS burger in Japan. MOS burger also has a beef rice burger. Marulilu's rice buns are slightly burned. My dining companion liked how the rice was lightly toasted, but I prefer the MOS burger version of the rice buns.\n\nThey also have all-day breakfasts. Their cheapest breakfast set is $5.99. Two eggs, two hashbrowns, two pieces of toast and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham. What a steal.

How unfortunate, because parking is a lot easier to locate after 6pm. \n\nBut nonetheless, lets get to the food aspect:\nOrdered the simple basic omurice. Was good. Egg was nicely pan fried, but was still left moist. I guess I would've prefered it if it was a tad bit more fluffy. Taste was there, but of course a bit bland, but thats where you have fun with your ketchup! Omurice, isn't omurice without your ketchup design :) Underneath the nice plain egg, is your lightly fried and flavored rice, with edamame beans. I think the mixture of the rice and plain omurice goes well together. And what an omurice should be like :)\n\nPortions are a bit small for us, greedy westernized folks. But really.. thats the portion we should eat on a regular basis. Plus its only ~$7. :)\n\nOrdered the Macha Latte. Its literally.. Warm milk with macha powder. Very strong macha flavor. Not sweet, wish they added a whee bit of sugar or honey (maybe i'm just too accustomed to the overly sweet green tea latte at starbucks). \n\nOverall: Cute and delicious!

While Columbus Brewing Company is slightly off the beaten path (tucked away in - appropriately - the Brewery District), that's where it gets a bit of its charm. It is somewhat of a secret to those who dare not divert from the safe routes of High Street, Olentangy and Lane Avenues. \n\nWhile the roads there may not be so dazzling, the restaurant itself has a fantastic decor and an amazing menu that is surprising and fun. Why choose the Columbus Brewing Company? If you're looking for the best locally brewed craft beer, look no further. Columbus Brewing Company offers more than 6 different beers (certain beers available only during certain seasons). My suggestion? Get the SAMPLER and taste all of the beers in all of their glory:\n\nThe Columbus Apricot Ale and the 1859 Porter range from light and fruity to dark and hoppy, respectively. There's a beer for all personalities. I once visited in March 2010 in which the seasonal beer of the month was the \"Arnold\" in celebration of the Arnold Fitness Classic. It got its namesake by the very strong hoppy bite it had...I wish it were around all year, but that's why it's fun to go back and see what new beers they have.\n\nThe place gets 5 stars not on its beer alone. Its food is all around fantastic. I couldn't decide between the sweet teriyaki calamari or the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, so at the suggestion of our amazingly friendly and helpful waitress, I got BOTH and still couldn't tell you which is tastier!\n\nFor dinner, my suggestions are the Caribbean style burrito (it comes with mouth watering plantains that everyone should try at least once in their life) and the pulled pork sandwich (I don't recall its name specifically, but it's darn good!). \n\nI never had room for dessert here at the CBC, but wouldn't doubt that it too is great. \n\nCome here to get a true taste of Columbus and some of the best service around. Don't forget to wash down your meals with a beer sampler if you're 21!\n\nPS: Also came here for a Christmas\/\/holiday party for work and had the staff come around with small horsdoeuvres...all great!","product_category":"Beer"},{"product_id":"OFwU816bVkCB7jMXbn1T_w","review_body":"I don't know why this restaurant doesn't get more chatter, but I've been here a half dozen times and I've never had a bad meal.

A dedicated parking lot is a nice perk in the downtown area.\n\nMy last visit, we had the pretzel bread appetizer which was super delicious.  I had the ale-braised pot roast, which was flavorful and tender.  The biscuits were yummy as well.  A strong option in the Brewery District.","product_category":"Beer"},{"product_id":"OFwU816bVkCB7jMXbn1T_w","review_body":"Good food.  The pecan chicken, hamburgers, pizza, and appetizers are great.

Have now been there twice, first time for beer and apps, second time with coworkers for a full dinner and beers.\n\nThe beers are beyond good, their IPA is fantastic and one of the best IPAs around. First time I was there, they had Bodhi, and Bodhi is my favorite IPA...period. Also, they have a great selection of guest taps, which it seems they are very picky about, and they pull together some great other Ohio brews.\n\nOrdered the Beer battered Asparagus as an appetizer, and Buffalo BBQ Chicken sandwich with garlic fries and extra side of fried plantains. Well, it was all absolutely fantastic. The appetizer was very enjoyable, my only complaint is that the asparagus would pull out of the breading fairly easily. The sandwich was absolutely perfect, the fries were amazing and the fried plantains were just icing on the cake. I think I will be ordering this combo again and again.

Just had the carrot juice today and it was very fresh. Don't recommend the mint smoothie -- it was largely pieces of mint leaf on ice. Another must-have is the rice pudding. It's covered in shaved coconut, coconut milk and spices that make it taste remarkably different from usual bland rice pudding.\n\nNot a fan of the service. The key is to go to the bar and chase down a server rather than wait for them to come to you.

Again, the salad, beans, and surprisingly the mashed potatoes, were incredibly bland. The fluke was dry and had close to no flavor.\n\nFor me, the salmon with spinach and bacon bits special. Spinach tasted like spinach but nothing special. The bacon, which is nearly impossible to make taste bad, sucked. The salmon had been cooked so long that skin on the bottom was burnt to the fish and couldn't be removed. Also, they topped it with a garnish of pickled fiddlehead ferns, which didn't mix well and was kind of gross.\n\nAltogether the price came out to $75, which is a hell of a lot for really crappy food.\n\nOverall?

My partner wanted to leave on the spot but like the fool I am I said \"no, look, there are people here! It must be ok.\" I will be making up for that with her for the rest of my life.\n\nThe menu is absurdly overpriced. Seriously, expect north end pricing, or at least similar to legal sea foods, etc. lobster rolls were $24 I think which puts them really up there. \n\nAppetites waning, we ended up ordering a shrimp salad, and griddled corn bread. The salad sounded fresh and cornbread is cornbread. Right? Wrong!!!! The salad was chopped up into tiny tiny pieces and the shrimp were microscopic. a few looked mangled like someone had bit them and spit them back. I dug in, hoping it was just a bad appearance, not necessarily bad food, but I could hardly get it down. The texture was grainy and the flavors were overpowering. The cornbread was thin, greasy, and soggy on the bottom.\n\nI hope that this place does have some good food items that surprise people.

Everything went downhill from there.\nWe started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. \nDo not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location).","product_category":"Cocktail"},{"product_id":"Sgm85LgzOGfcImy5jc9ijQ","review_body":"Being that the pan-roasted lobster is one of my last meal picks I feel obligated to rate this place. It is my current annual birthday meal request. \n\nMy introduction to the pan-roasted lobster was spurned by hearing that this was a requested dish of Julia Child's. I thought, now here is a woman who could have any dish that she wants. If she had this often and it was within driving distance then I simply had to try it. It was luv at first bite, Jasper White is my hero. The bourbon, chives, and roasting technique are what make this dish out of this world. I always have leftovers but honestly it is not as good the next day. The butter emulsion falls apart and you get clarified butter when you warm it up instead of that smooth white butter sauce that coated the lobster the day before. Try to eat it in one sitting. \n\nIf it is in the Summer try their fresh watermelon margaritas. The pulverized fruit really makes the drink refreshing. My mom loves their fried oysters. They have a grilled sardine appetizer in the Summer that my dad just goes ga ga over. Something for everyone. Their specials have always been good picks. The cornbread that comes with the meal is also good. My son had a soft-serve ice cream cone at the end of the meal that was larger than his face. His eyes grew really big when it came to the table.\n\nI've only had one bad experience there. It was a special occasion and I decided to surprise my dad by calling ahead to request the grilled Sardines, because the last time he went it wasn't on the menu and he was sad. I did not think that this was too difficult a request seeing that I had given the chef a week's notice and I had seen sardines in-season at the local markets. Maybe it was the hostess who did not get the message to the chef, but when we showed up the waiter came back and said \"sorry, but the chef could not get them.\"  Hmm. Someone in these reviews said that this is a chef's restaurant. You'd think that a chef would have cared enough to have someone call me back since I gave them my phone number and said that it was a special request.

The mussels were cooked in a tomato sauce as oposed to more of a broth which I prefer but they were still tasty. The ravioli was fantastic, filled with different kinds of mushrooms and topped with tomato sauce that had tons of basil in it. The only real gripe that I had about the place is that they use what looks to be parmesean cheese out of the shaker (they just pour it into a bowl to serve you), in my opinion if you are trying to be a more upper class restaurant than its a must to grate it at the table.\n\nTheir lunch prices were also very reasonable. $6.00 for the mussels and $9.50 for my entree.","product_category":"Italian"},{"product_id":"T4GbWPx-KXi_6-xDrVT1BA","review_body":"How could you not feel special finding this place.  The location is absolutely surreal for a restaurant of this caliber.  There is a Jack in the Box and Check Cashing shop in the same strip mall.

So, in a strange way, the location works.\nInside, the decor is not overly done, but the seats are comfortable, the tables have tablecloths and real napkins, and the hostess looks like she stepped out of an Italian movie from the 60's.  So by the time you are sitting down looking at the menu, you are in a pretty good mood.  \nThe prices are amazing, especially for lunch.  The selection is good, and the choices are fairly standard Italian, nothing too fancy.  All the meals I have had were well prepared.  Nothing over cooked, nor undercooked, even the vegetables on the side are just right.  This level of consistency is hard to find at lunch, so major points there.  I usually share a starter like the fried calamari and have pasta or an entree and come out at under $15.  For the quality of food, this feels like a true bargain. \n\nThe deserts are great, especially if you like Tiramisu.  I rarely have room for it, but am tempted to order it to go as it is so tasty.  The espresso is also strong and bitter with a little lemon peel on the side.  Very Italian, very nice end to a meal.  \n \nService for lunch is fast and friendly.

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \n\nPros:\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\n\nCons:\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n\nThe interior\/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!","product_category":"Italian"},{"product_id":"T4GbWPx-KXi_6-xDrVT1BA","review_body":"I went here with a small group the other night.

We also got the Fried Cheese Bread which was ok but probably wont get it again, its kind of a novelty item in my mind and I really preferred the herbed bread that they serve with our meal.

We loved the food there, and affirm that the portions are huge, the overall value is very good (Hey! you can't spell 'value' w\/o the letters V-A-L), and the service, warm and personable. Val has been on her game in the Couve for about 2.5 years now, after refining her most sacred shao-lin technique with her hot pots, in downtown Portland \"for about 15-16 years.\"\n\nDeserving special mention from the menu were the triple-decker Ruebenator, and the philly cheese-steak scramble. So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again.\n\n\nThe one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider  later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades.  If Stepping Stone can do it, you most definitely can dooo it.\n\nVal and co: you're a shining star, no matter who you are.

I was greeted promptly.  I later found out, it was Valerie the owner.  \n\nThe menu had it's usual breakfast fare and as I scanned the plates coming out of the kitchen the portions were very generous and reasonably priced.\n\nMy first goto at any new breakfast joint is the Corned Beef Hash.  I asked Valerie if it was homemade or canned and I was informed they have 2 options. Canned or a frozen product they obtain from a place in Portland.  Valerie said though it's very tasty and I recall having something similar before at other places so I opted for the latter.\n\nOne of my key drivers of determining a good restaurant is how the eggs come out. I always order Over Easy with my hash and some places are spot on, while others the yolks are not runny enough.\n\nMy eggs were spot on.  Whites cooked and yolks, runny.  Good Job!\n\nThe hash did not taste frozen at all.  In fact, had I not known it was a frozen product, I would have thought they made it in house.  Definitely good Corned Beef Hash at BAV.\n\nI also enjoyed their menu providing two options.  A full breakfast for about $9-$10 or a smaller version for about $7-$8.  There was plenty of food on the smaller version.  \n\nAnother plus was I had the choice of Potatoes, Pancakes, Toast or Biscuits and Gravy.  I went with the Biscuits and Gravy and they were tasty.  If' you've read my other posts about Biscuits and Gravy in Vancouver, it's hard to find a decent place.  Biscuits provides a good Biscuit but the gravy is subpar.  Carol's Corner provides a good gravy but the Biscuit is subpar.  Here at BAV you get a good biscuit and a tasty gravy.\n\nBAV also serves Huffin-n-Puffin Hot Sauce.  YIPEE!!  This is a locally made hot sauce and not many places carry it.  Kudos to BAV for doing so.\n\nI was impressed too by the service.  Maybe it was because I was at the counter, I don't know but I was checked on frequently and everytime my Iced Tea was low, it was refilled without having to ask.\n\nI'll definitely go back to BAV again and try some of their other Breakfast offerings.","product_category":"American"},{"product_id":"TDQ0lSTHW3RyfVWQuwbBGg","review_body":"Good food and plenty of it.

So i called back.  I ended up getting a hold of her again (although the young lady before her, who answered my call, was almost as rude as Juanita), Juanita would not give me her supervisor\/bosses name, she said \"i am the highest person in charge\", and i asked her why did she hang up on me?

We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....\n\nAt Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.\n\nOn a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. \n\nLastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse. Save your money and go somewhere else!","product_category":"Amusement"},{"product_id":"U9lrX8Nviajz-74dF6zL7g","review_body":"I think the amount of fun you will have here depends on who you go with and what you want to do. I went with my son today (2\/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. \n\nFamilies with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)\n\nFamilies with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! \n\nFamilies that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. \n\nHowever if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.\n\nOn 2\/23 the one \"roller coaster\", Atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. \n\nHe also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  \n\nThe food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. \n\nThe cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. \n\nSo, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.","product_category":"Amusement"},{"product_id":"U9lrX8Nviajz-74dF6zL7g","review_body":"Shamu!

No spice at all and I asked for it to be spicy. Also what they advertise as biryani was not actual biryani, it looked like they just mixed curry gravy into rice, which isn't what biryani is.

I've seen some of my favorite shows here- Prince, Justin Timberlake, Matisyahu, Pharrell, etc.  Also came last night to watch Ali Wong's comedy show.  There isn't a bad seat in the house at the Tabernacle.  It's an intimate venue with 3 viewing levels.  The acoustic is great too inside.  They also have several drink stations throughout the venue.  Note- they have to take off the caps on the water bottles here so drink up. \n\nThe only downfall I could think of us is that there are no elevators and tons of stairs so plan accordingly.  If you don't want to climb a lot of stairs I would suggest getting seats on the main floor or second floor.  The seats on the second balcony (3rd level) I feel has very good view of the stage but the seats are pretty close from row to row.   There isn't a lot of legroom but I think that's probably one of the best views in the venue if you're sitting in the middle.

I was left neither disappointed, or amazed. \n\nThe view, on the standing portion of the venue, and the balcony up top was stellar- not a bad seat to be had. However, the venue was a tad too loud for my liking (since the sound bounced off the walls) especially up in the balcony. \n\nBy the way, beware if you sit down in the seats at the balcony, though. The seats smell like someone pooted.

First the positives, this is the first time I have been down here since this property was Jaime's.  The re-design is beautiful and it looks like they have an fantastic patio to sip drinks and people watch.  However, this is where the warm fuzzies go away.  We arrived at around 6 PM and even though the patio was pretty busy the inside seemed dead.  We asked the host how long the wait would be and he stated 45 minutes for inside, as we were conferring to decide if we were going to wait he walked away.  As we were talking I looked into the restaurant and saw at least 3-5 empty tables and then as I walked around looked into a second room and saw literally 15-20 more empty tables.  When the host returned we asked about all the empty tables and he said he could not seat us because they did not want to overload the kitchen.  I'm sorry but a 45 minute wait to sit at one of your 20+ empty tables is not acceptable.  Best of luck but we will not be one of your patrons.","product_category":"Tex-Mex"},{"product_id":"_rt-Z934kfFzgG19nTrIcQ","review_body":"Great drinks at the tequila bar!

The only room that really creeped me out was the kiddies room. It has all these old dolls just perfectly lined up and looking at you. Jesus, it reminded me of Amityville Horror or something.

The inside was well cared for and curated to show a traditional upper class home for the time. Wonderful furnishings and fixtures were set up with great informative and descriptive signs to enjoy. Most of the home is furnished in a way to reflect opulence and wealth but not really how the original family lived there. Most furnishings were far more glam than the pictures of the original rooms which is explained in several areas but I would have liked to see more of the original items or replications of them at least.

How disappointing.\n\nIt was a hot summer night, and there's no ventilation inside the restaurant. It's like a sauna in there -- we walked in, and almost walked right out. If it weren't for the fact that a table for two was available right away, we probably would have left. Maybe we should have.\n\nWe ordered the chicken liver with capers crostini ($6) which was just ok. It was basically pate, and I like pate, but I was expecting chicken livers -- something a little bit different from pate smeared on toast. Capers were fried beyond recognition or taste.\n\nWhen the caprese (buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes & basil, $10) arrived, we nearly gasped. The portion was so small, given the price -- maybe 5 cherry-size tomatoes sliced in half, with a chunk of cheese. It tasted okay, but not worth $10.\n\nWhen the pancetta (and... I can't remember) pizza ($15) arrived, we actually gasped out loud because nearly half of the pizza's surface was charred black. We looked up at the waitress, and asked in disbelief, \"is it supposed to be this burned?\" She sheepishly answered yes, but offered to do it again if we didn't like it. Uh huh. \n\nWhen she took it back to the man-in-charge-of-pizza (not the owner-chef) standing no more than 10 feet away, he angrily tossed the whole pie into the trash. It took another 15 minutes for the replacement to arrive, and though not charred on top, the bottom was still severely burnt black. I don't know -- crispy is one thing, but why would I pay money to eat soot?\n\nThe pancetta was super salty, as pancetta can be, but there was nothing else on the pizza to offset or balance the saltiness. It was almost inedible, but we were so hungry by then. In short, the pizza was a disaster.\n\nIn conclusion. Strike 1: I was fanning my face with the menu the whole time because it was so unbearably hot in there. Strike 2: The Caprese is a ripoff. Strike 3. When the table next to us cleared, a waitress used a scented chemical-smelling cleaning spray and a rag to wipe it down, and we had to sit for the rest of the evening smelling Pinesol-like fumes. Strike 4. They had the audacity to serve us a $15 pizza that should have gone into the trash to begin with.\n\nSo nope. We're not going back.

If it were, the bar would be made of real marble (or at least granite) and not that cheap stuff that doesn't even feel like corian; and the waitress wouldn't be serving up her attitude dressed up in jeans and a tank.

Of course other patrons are regulars and will not bother to let you know that you have to sign in.\n\nFresh pizza slices were offered to the waiting patrons though, so it was quite thoughtful of them.  But the server didn't tell me clearly to sign in even when I asked if I need to put my name down; she said someone, \"brad\", will take my name, or at least that's what I heard over the loud music and chattering. You have to put your name down yourself, which reads from left to right, btw.\n\nWhy do some restaurants insist on making their patrons fight over who can be seated first themselves?

Im not from the area, and my GF whos from there, gassed this place up to be something special. Went on a Friday night recently, around 8. Some lady who worked there helped us find a spot in their lot, which was a nice touch, as parking in SoBo is beyond attrocious, cars might as well be banned from parking within the city limits. We sat near the bar area...Hella loud in there, sounded like some obnoxious souls were in the vicinity. Yelling and hollering and such,I mean i get it its a a bar but it was only around 8. We get seated and waited around 10m to get a waitress to our table. Service overall was really slow. After we got our decent cocktails, another 15-20m passed before we got approached to order meals. \n\nAs for the food, we decided to just get entrees. My Gf got the pork chop and it seemed to crisped on the outside, almost burnt. Her risotto was decent, but overall it was lackluster. I was gunna opt for the prime rib, they were out of it at the time. No biggie I had a lobster pie in the on deck circle...So I got it, really rubbery and quite bland. The portion wasnt that great either. Not sure why I got fries with it, but I did. The fries were ok, oversalted thought. We waited another 15m after we were done for the check. When the check came, my GF and I split the bill...For the food and service we got, this place is overpriced...I heard the quality took a dive after they remodeled it, from my GF whos been going there for a while.

Week later we went to the Lincoln Tavern up the road, and I was blown away that place was incredible and a better value.\n\nFinal note, after I ate here and checked some other reviews the night of, I stumbled across one of the restaurants customer service reps for yelp, Don. His replies were very unprofessional, belittling of the reviewer, yet entertaining, due to the fact  I couldn't believe someone who represents the establishment would write such things. I read all the poor reviews to see him go to the point of attacking the patron and accusing them of being at fault for their poor service, never seen anything like it.

I ordered the Pumpkin Risotto and also had a fair amount left on the plate.  We ask the waitress to pack our leftovers and she comes back with a plastic bag containing the leftovers in two boxes.  We never opened the leftovers at the restaurant to check, I mean why would we?  I guess we were naive to assume that the restaurant would give us the food we paid for.\n\nWe came home and decided to put the food away in the fridge.  That's when we noticed that the box containing my brothers food was tiny, compared to mine.  This was despite the fact that his portion was much larger and he barely ate a quarter of it.  It was at that point we realized that  either the waiter or the kitchen staff had basically taken my brothers leftovers for themselves and put a skimpy serving in a small take out box.\n\nI hope this is clear.  THEY TOOK OUR LEFTOVERS FOR THEMSELVES!  WHO DOES THAT?\n\nWe are joking about how this plot mirrored a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode and then we decided to go on Yelp and see if anyone else had a similar experience.  I have not read a review like this yet, but there are plenty of 1-2 star ratings, we ended up learning about other shady practices such as not honoring vouchers and not giving customers back exact change (i.e. rounding off totals for themselves).  To be honest I don't think the whole thing about the change is that big a deal, but when I compared that to the experience we just had I couldn't believe that this restaurant continues to be in operation.\n\nBasically Amrheins was the most screwed up eating experience I've ever had.  I'm looking forward to telling EVERYONE about what happened to us.","product_category":"American"},{"product_id":"loRoCo53b30zgHZ_mIMatQ","review_body":"I agree with you yelpers, the upscale bar food is AMAZING!  \nI love the atmosphere, dark wood, booths and friendly service.\nSkip the chicken buffalo dip which is way too spicy but try the butternut ravioli which is fab!

It's a nice, quaint restaurant just a block from Broadway T station (Red Line).\n\nWe were led to the older part of the building.  A bit rustic but very nice.  \n\nWe had a very good waitress who was friendly, courteous and who always check up on us every three minutes or so.   She also carried a nice conversation with me and my buddy.\n\nI ordered one of weekly specials, Lobster Casserole.  Full of huge, lobster chunks and a thick layer of crab meat underneath.  There was not much of breadcrumbs in their casserole.  Great for people who are in to low-carb diet.  :)    The casserole had just a touch of fat.  It was not too buttery.\n\nThe casserole was lightly dusted with breadcrumbs.  Some restaurants use breadcrumbs to bind everything together and make one solid goo.  They did their casserole well.\n\nFor dessert, I had their tiramisu.  It was very good also, comparable to the restaurants that I usually eat in the Financial District where I work.  Yes, there's nothing special about their tiramisu but that's because they did it as good as the more expensive restaurants downtown.\n\nOne thing that I like about this restaurant is that they serve fine foods but it does not feel that you're coming to a restaurant that serves snotty crowd.  This is a restaurant where you can eat fine food and still feel relax and comfortable, much like a holiday dinner with family (not in-laws) and friends.","product_category":"American"},{"product_id":"loRoCo53b30zgHZ_mIMatQ","review_body":"I traveled to Boston on business and wanted to go somewhere non-touristy.  I found Amrhein's on this website and thought it may just be what I was looking for and basically it was.  There was a bit of a wait, but the food was outstanding.  The lobster pie was one of the most rich, decadent and downright mouth-watering dishes I have ever had in my entire life.  Really though, how can you go wrong with butter, fresh lobster and crab stuffing???  The hand-carved wood bar was beautiful, the service was a bit slow but very pleasant and she did the job.  Overall I would definitely like to try some of the other dishes on the menu (namely the lobster macaroni) so the next time I'm in Boston I will definitely check this place out again.","product_category":"American"},{"product_id":"ncRoLv6zWxQaMjLj1ZC_uA","review_body":"Go for the Brussels sprouts. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes, but those Brussels sprouts really stood out.

Also I LOVED the interesting stories behind each drink featured on the menu.

It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.\n\nMoving along.\n\nCrab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.\n\nChinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.\n\nOnion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. \n\nBrussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. \n\nKorean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.\n\nThe space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. \n\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it. \n\nOne of the best meals around. I'll be back again and again. Truly special in a town where the bar is set pretty high.","product_category":"Nightlife"},{"product_id":"ncRoLv6zWxQaMjLj1ZC_uA","review_body":"The Hot & Sour Indian Spiced Fries take the cake... well, potato anyway!

The food, the music, the staff, all interesting (in a good way). Overall, I liked the food, but some of the dishes had components that could be improved. \n\nThe brocolini, ragu and toast was good bite when everything was combined, but as individual components, might be one of the most odd trio of items. I think I would prefer this dish pre-assembled to make sure the customer gets the memo on how it's supposed to be eaten. Eating the brocolini alone was horrible and lacking all flavor. Eating the ragu alone made me wonder where the pasta might be, and eating the toast alone made me think, there must be more. \n\nWho the F_ck is David Chang? Winner of the best dish name award by a long shot. The flavors are all there, but a bit heavy on the mayo sauce for me making everything very slippery in the bun. Also, the bun was well made, light and fluffy. \n\nThe shiso leaf wrapped \"tacos\" were interesting, but should have been wrapped with a different leafy green instead. The texture of the shiso is a bit waxy and not that enjoyable. I wanted a crisp crunch of some lettuce. \n\nMusic throughout the meal was awesome. They have a great mix going and I found myself looking up a few songs along throughout the meal. \n\nService was also top notch.

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.","product_category":"Karaoke"},{"product_id":"oug5bLTWP_YTtj1C3_X6Xw","review_body":"Have a lot of love for this place. It's almost a five stars for me, though a few things stop me from going that far.\n\nFirst I'll go into all the awesome parts. Decent beer selection with Austin craft beers. The building itself is pretty sweet. It has the feel of a log cabin mixed with a micro-home, and I think that's awesome. Some of the tables appeared to be old, crank-operated types that you'd see in the Edwardian period. The food is amazing, like I broke into heaven and devoured the angels themselves. And I pigged out too. There are very nicely fried mozzarella chunks that go great with the buttermilk dipping sauce. Then the Dirty South entree is flawless. Country fried steak, gravy, doughnut, and a habanero jam. Finished it off with a Black Betty. It was superb.   \n\nThe only things I didn't like....the atmosphere seems confused inside. Rustic cabin bursting at the seams with TVs? Come on, I'm already fat and dying from the food but  now I have to yell over them to make conversation too? A place like that would be improved with an old jukebox instead. Or at least with less TVs. The service wasn't that good either, though I concede that perhaps that was a fluke or something. Also the fried mozzarella has a garlic butter sauce that has waaaay too much salt, like a person with a faulty tongue may have made it. \n\nI'll certainly go back but I am saddened a little, since I so much want to just love this place. Take out those TVs, make it a bit more relaxed, and maybe something fun in the patio (like a Bocce lane).","product_category":"Karaoke"},{"product_id":"rXxC_ZH58EItO3m5PASzEA","review_body":"We were visiting Boston for Labor Day weekend.

It's so rare to have a space like this, and I loved the fact that I was studying under the beautiful blue skies and natural light. (How awesome would it be to read a book while it's drizzling outside in this room?!)\n\nFood\/drink: I got the double espresso and a bacon & cheese quiche, and both were splendid. The double espresso was pulled perfectly both times I ordered, and with a touch of brown sugar, brought out the bright and tangy flavors (not too much acidity, I love it!). The quiche was not as warm as I would have liked it, but I loved the single portion style of it, with the amazing crunchy crust that holds the whole thing together.\nService: I think the fact that they bring out your drinks to you is a great touch to the shop.

They need to bring on additional waitstaff because you will end up holding your check for about 10-15 minutes and wait even longer to place your order. Don't plan on having your drinks refilled. Potatoes and other dishes that should be served hot were cold and pretty bland. Coffee was really watered down.

Then I got tempted by their bagel menu, so ordered a toasted ham and cheese on an everything bagel. Delish! It came out hot and gooey, just the way I like it. Sitting in the huge, cushiony arm chairs by the window made me feel nice and cozy too. Friendly staff, quiet and pleasant atmosphere, and good food to warm you up. Can't ask for more!","product_category":"Coffee"},{"product_id":"u0V8PEMTDSoD7Ub8jVKuwg","review_body":"Jaho brings back the coffee Houses of ole! Good job guys! Not only have the folks at Jaho brought me back to the old houses of the Seattle kind in the comfortable atmosphere and great location but the coffee! It speaks for itself. Located just off the pier in Salem with outdoor seating for the occasional people watching as well as indoor lounging of the warm heated blanket kind. Wrap yourself in the people, the places, the coffee. Jaho delivers!

The dressing was way to acidic (all lemon not much oil).

The elevator wasn't really working so we had to go into another restaurant to use the stairs to get to this second floor restaurant (a little strange).  \n\nWe had falafel (DELICIOUS - only trumped by the ones i got at a food truck in NY)l, baba ganoush (I could NOT stop eating this eggplant goodness), flatbread - delicious.\n\nWe loved the lush seating and yummy food - was only a little bit surprised with the attention we were getting from the belly dancer...

We went to Truva for an early dinner (too early for the belly dancer). I should have read the reviews earlier as we got confused by the dark stairs. We tried to go onto the kitchen of the steak restaurant downstairs. Once we arrived at the top of the stairs we received a friendly welcome. \n\nWe started our meal with an appetizer of cabbage rolls. They were excellent.  The server brought bread with excellent oil and balsamic. We ordered the stuffed chicken meal and the lamb kabob. The chicken was good but the gravy had a bottom of the pan burnt taste. Sauteed Spinach and Truva potatoes were the two sides that came with the stuffed chicken. The kabob came with rice and a small Mediterranean salad. The lamb had excellent seasoning. \n\nThe restaurant was nice and the experience may have been better if were eating later and could have experienced the dancer.","product_category":"Turkish"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"I took a friend out for a birthday dinner here on Monday (1\/29\/18) and our reservation was at 9:15pm and we arrived a tad bit late at 9:20pm (Downtown Parking). But despite being late we were welcomed and seated right away, it was a Monday night so they weren't incredibly busy. Because the restaurant closed at 10pm, I thought for sure that we were going to get sub-par service (bad experiences) and that who comes in 40 minutes before closing look but the service was great and the food was even better. I highly recommend the grove to anyone looking for a good downtown Italian meal and an extensive wine list. Will for sure be back!","product_category":"Cafes"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"Modern restaurant over looking the creek\/river\/currently dried up body of water, there is an indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nThe portions are filling enough, and the ingredients are very fresh. I ordered the Capellini with arugula and tomatoes, added chicken. I do want to note that it comes with a very scrumptious toast, soft and toasty. It was definitely a great touch to the white wine and butter sauce. \n\nThe prices are better than average for a downtown restaurant. \n\nThe only concern I had were the gnats and small flys that swarmed our table when the food came. It was not great for entertaining guests. However, if you focus really hard on the person sitting opposite of you, you can almost pretend they're not invading your space like the Californians are invading Austin. Just kidding, I love Californians. :)","product_category":"Cafes"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"Sorry this is a no from us. Four of us dined here earlier in the week. Three people couldn't even eat their meals they were that bad. The soup tasted just like a bowl of warm cinnamon, the creamy chicken pasta had so much blue cheese it was inedible. Spaghetti bolognese wasn't too bad. Drinks were good, Moscow mule not served in a copper cup (that's just being picky). Espresso martinis were good. The decor reminded me of the lobby of a holiday inn express. Server was in training but really good.","product_category":"Cafes"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"I usually go to the Grove on Bee Cave's or Lola Savannah with my laptop to work and order coffee and the crab cakes and butternut squash soup from the Grove. I actually went on a first date at the restaurant on Bee Cave's and the waitress rushed me the whole time thus making me uncomfortable and not feeling quite so charming on my date. As it was our first date, there is a lot to talk about and it should not be rushed. She asked to take my entree maybe 3 times and was clearly annoyed with me and my date could see that as well. I shouldn't blame her at all, but I feel this did not allow me to give the best first impression. However, I am in love with the crab cakes at The Grove because it is pure, delicious lumpy crab meat without all the fillers. I happened to be going out to Dogwood with my friend on West Sixth and saw the downtown location and was craving my crab cakes and Bruscetta combo before going out. \n\nLuckily I had the best experience with Jason as our waiter. He did not rush me at all and suggested a fantastic wine for us (I am clueless about wine so I let him decide for me). Now I can just go to the downtown location so I can enjoy my favorite crab cakes and have good service and enjoy some good wine to start out a night of dancing! Jason assured me that he also works Brunches as well, so that gives me an incentive to try the brunch menu that looks amazing. He restored my faith in one of my favorite places to eat. Not to bash the Westlake location however; I probably just had one bad experience and was nervous on my date. The staff at Lola Savannah are always wonderful. I am glad to be able to have a new Saturday night schedule that includes being able to get the world's best crab cake and service combined!","product_category":"Cafes"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"I went out for brunch by myself after working OT at my job. It's very chic and modern and I would have easily mistaken it as a very expensive restaurant. It's not that expensive. I was glad they didn't mind my casual look and I was able to sit down in the cocktail lounge area which had a view of 6th Street. \n\nI was bummed they didn't have the Acai Berry smoothie and I wasn't in the mood for coffee because the last thing I needed was more coffee in my system. I ordered for appetizer the Fried Point Judith Calamari which basically I'm a sucker for Fried Calamari. It's one of those items where if a restaurant, I'll order it without hesitation. Then I had the Kobe Burger w\/ cheddar, avocado and bacon. It was stacked very high and it was guaranteed to fall apart when I take the first bite. The food and the service was good.","product_category":"Cafes"},{"product_id":"vo1MjyIvHbAJ93PasKHIRg","review_body":"Had my birthday dinner here with some family out on the outdoor patio which was the perfect setting.

The location is great! And it has a gorgeous (and extremely large) patio overlooking Shoal Creek! \n\nLots of wines and reasonably priced flights! I had a delicious flight of sparkling roses for $15! They also have cocktails which looked great! \n\nGreat menu! Tons of vegetarian options, and their gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options are clearly marked on the menu! Three of us shared six different types pf bruschetta - you can choose 3 for $10! (Don't miss the Brie, fig jam, and apple!) we also had the Brussels sprouts, which were awesome! We wanted to eat more-so much of the menu looks delicious!! \n\nI'd love to go again for happy hour!! \n\nInside is a little upscale, but people sitting outside were dressed very casually!!","product_category":"Cafes"}]
