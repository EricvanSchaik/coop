Needless to say, this remote, the CLIKR-5, is awesome, easily programmed, and works perfectly with our TWC equipment and all the other A\/V components.  I love this remote... great product.

I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.    Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth\/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.    I'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.    My complaints are relatively minor:    Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.    The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and\/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.    There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.    Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.    [[ASIN:0528881469 Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS]]"},{"product_id":"0528881469","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\\\\\" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7\\\\\".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\\\\\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\\\\\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:                                                  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),                                2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).                                                                     3) large 7\\\\\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving                                                                                   4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.                                                                5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \\\\\"Construction Ahead\\\\\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.                                                                                                  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.                                                        7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.                                                                             8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.                                                                                                       9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route                                  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)       11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)                                                             12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)        13) ittells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.                                                                                                                14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.   Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy."},{"product_id":"0528881469","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I have owned two Rand McNally GPS devices over the last two years. Buyer beware!

The unit has a bad probleum with the 12 volty pulg in. They replaced the unit once in 6 months and the second unit last about 8 months before it started giving me trouble, but would they stand behind it NO NO NO. They said it had been over a year since I had bought the first unit so it was not covered.  The person I talked with at the Tec centered knew very well what I was talking about. If I made something that cost as much and made claims of how great a unit it was I would stand behind it and if I knew of probleums with the 12 plug in I would come up with a fix.

There were a few times that it routed me thru some residential areas and a couple of times I wondered if a truck was even legal at all. I loved the feature where I could see if there was a truck stop or rest area close by though it does not have them all. My main concern or problem with this device is in the charging port. The unit get to hot at this port. I went thru 3 12vlt chargers and 1 house wall charger. eventually the plug in had got to the point of being brittle and fell apart. I talk to Rand McNally about this they sent me 1 12 volt charger. But I had to pay for the rest and if I wanted them to look at it I would have to pay shipping out of my pocket. I have a problem with that because I paid so much for it to start. I had it about 2 mos. when it started having problems. I had it 10 mos. when it finally became useless and I thrrew it away.

Dave Ramsey's CD's and program are easy listening and totally do-able!<br \/><br \/>My family member was a die-hard instant gratification\/impulse spender and now I'm happy to say has listened to Dave Ramsey and has implemented Dave's strategies. I'm not talking about a kid here, this person is in his mid-fifties and has had this unconscious spending mindset all of his life. From the very first Dave Ramsey CD that he popped into his car CD player, he was hooked! He even looked forward to repetitive listening of each CD several times to have it become ingrained in his memory before moving on to the next one...very cool!<br \/><br \/>His transformation is amazing! He's turned his life around to be a financial wizard and has learned how to accelerate getting out of debt years sooner than he otherwise would have done.<br \/><br \/>He's so much more financially responsible with his retirement planning\/investment funds\/insurance policies and especially of conscious spending of his money.

We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.    The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.    While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.    The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.  It really doesn't have the horsepower for that."},{"product_id":"1400532655","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"The reviews so far are really good, so I dont need to add more on the actual features. Now did you know that buying directly from B & N, the Nookcolor is actually $249? Also, for those who are concerned about the lcd, dont worry. You can adjust the brightness level. I lower it when I read at night in the dark, and when its daylight and I want more clarity, I can brighten it. You can use literature published in so many digital formats (but not amazon kindle format, which doesnt play well with others), and its just a pleasure to use. Someone mentioned that when you have it plugged for charging and try to type on the keyboard, it doubles the characters. Yeah, been there, done that, true story, so hopefully as they update the software, that will improve, but once you unplug, everything seems to work very nicely. If you want a nice reading environment, I really would recommend the nook color. It makes reading such a pleasure, at a very decent price for the product you are buying. I actually like that it has a tiny bit of \\\\\"weight\\\\\" to it. Now my little droid incredible, which had been my reader til I got the NookColor, feels so...light! Almost TOO light! And...it LOOKS so elegant. I actually prefer having the plastic\/metal (not sure what it is actually, but it feels nice and looks nicer) bezel as opposed to the ipad glass to the edge type construction. It gives me a nice place to put my fingers. And get a nice cover for it. B & N has some very nice ones. Yes, some are a bit pricey, but I really think its worth the investment. Mine already has fallen to the carpeted ground when my dog figured I had been reading long enough, and wanted some attention. I was very glad I had it in a cover. However, with the bezel and the rubberized back, I dont think I would have had a heart attack if it fell uncovered. I would never risk that, but it looks and feels as though it could take a bit of a tumble without much trouble, at least onto carpet. It just seems less fragile than the ipad or galaxy tab.  The book collections are extensive, and I also had quite a collection of pdf books which I very easily downloaded. And I LOVE the free trial for the magazines. To discontinue any of them you decide you dont want, you have to log into your online nook account on the B $ N website, and find the \\\\\"manage subscriptions\\\\\" link. Took me a minute to figure that out, so hopefully that tidbit will save you some frustration. But overall, its a wonderful, colorful, very nice user experience. Its an ereader first and foremost, and it does that very well. It just happens to have a few lil extra goodies tossed in to boot! Dont compare it to the ipad. It isnt supposed to BE the ipad! Let it have its own little niche, and I promise you will be as happy with it as I am!"},{"product_id":"1400532655","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"Amazon lists the NOOKcolor for over $300 but it's available at barnesandnoble.com for $249 + tax (~$269.)

Good battery life, beautiful screen, responsive and a really excellent reader (especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use).  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email, RSS, games and reading, including pdf books and Netflix movies.

It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.  Good:  Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.  Bad  minor complaints):  that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.  Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.  UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.  UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.    Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.  Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add \\\\\"epub download\\\\\" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.<br \/><br \/>The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)"},{"product_id":"140053271X","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch\/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best.

I can't compare it to the Amazon Paperwhite, because I refuse to try one.  The Nook has expandable memory (which I do not believe the Paperwhite does).

If, for some reason, I need more space, then I can just drop another 15-20 bucks, and have another 32GB (though I will have my collection split over two memory cards).  I also like that B&N accepts ePub, which is pretty much the universal standard, whereas Amazon locks you into their own store.  This means that you can shop Sony's store with a Nook, and Nook's store with a Sony, but Amazon can't access either of those stores.<br \/><br \/>The downside to this is that, as of now, Amazon books tend to be cheaper than any other e-reader store.

I was really set on the Kindle but after reading some more about the Barnes & Noble Nook it really clicked with me.  I liked the idea of a user-accessible battery, and the formats that are compatible with this e-reader.  The B&N ebook library had a much larger selection at the time and of books i was really wanting that I couldn't find on amazon.  At first the touch screen seemed ridiculous and somewhat pointless, this caused me to really lean towards the Kindles as I figured it would really drain the battery and was more of a gimmick than a necessary part of the device. BUT after using the Nook it just makes navigation quick and awesome, totally won me over and I hope on the next gen they don't decide to do away with the touch screen.  You can set it to shut off when not in use for a few seconds and the battery lasts quite a long time.  When the touch screen is off it still works to turn pages.  You just swipe your finger across the dark screen, pages turn, it's quite nice.    E-readers in general didn't click with me, didn't think I'd really use it as anything more than a \\\\\"toy of the week,\\\\\" but after the first 2 weeks my Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too).  Navigating the bookstore is incredibly simple and I LOVE being able to read reviews online with it for books and making wishlists.  Finding selections of free ebooks is a snap.  The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it.  It is definitely superior to trying to read on an lcd screen.  Being able to change text size is also a huge plus (pretty standard on all ereaders, just stating my love for the option).  I haven't had a single software\/hardware problem at all so that is great.  The only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories\/folders (unless you can and I just don't know how).      Supposedly you can link up to 5 Nooks to one account so they can all share the same library of ebooks you've purchased so now I'm trying to get my family members to buy Nooks as well!

I'm currently in law school, and have numerous PDFs from various classes loaded onto it. Reading from an eReader is way easier on the eyes than constantly staring at a computer screen (and it costs the same as a single casebook).     I like the Nook's touchscreen interface; it can be a little slow at times, but I haven't had any major issues with it. One of my biggest factors for buying a Nook over a Kindle\/Sony was that Barnes & Noble is a BOOKSELLER. This device is designed with book readers in mind. The fact that I can loan eBooks from the library, read eBooks for free while at Barnes & Noble, and the overall design of the thing (multiple options for turning pages, I like to swipe the touchscreen vs. pushing the buttons) put the Nook far out in front. The fact that Barnes & Noble gives you 2 weeks to try the thing out put it over the edge. I initially bought the Wi-fi only version and it froze after the second day, I exchanged it for the Wi-fi\/3G at the store no questions asked.     Overall it's a great product and awesome for those that actually like books, not just having the latest gadget."},{"product_id":"1400599997","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I had every intention of loving this product, however I returned it immediately!

Most importantly I cannot insert a microSD card with my own epubs into it and this is why they gave you more memory. They hide the fact you cannot expand it with the card and charge you more to get less capacity.  I've never been more disappointed with an Amazon purchase and cannot understand why the B&N website doesn't point this out and neither does the Amazon website.  I'm returning mine ASAP and will order the &#34;Simple&#34; model with Glowlight--the &#34;simple&#34; one is more capable.  I am very disappointed in their marketing of this model (deliberately deceitful).  The reason I have liked the B&N readers is their expandability and this trumps the Kindle features in my mind."},{"product_id":"1400699894","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I've had my Nook GlowLight for almost a month now. Before purchasing it, I'd already had ebook readers from other major brands. The reason I bought this was because I saw in the ads that it has the auto-hyphenation function. Absolutely true. It has beautiful font types and can automatically hyphenate the text. I know some people may not care about auto hyphenation but it is very important for me as I prefer reading in larger font size. The ebook readers of other brands may be good in other respects but cannot display text as beautifully as Nook GlowLight does, especially when I use larger font size. The reason I have given it four stars is because the light is not even enough on the top of the page. There has been great improvement from Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight to Nook GlowLight in this respect, but there is still room for improvement. In spite of this and other shortcomings, in terms of reading, this is the best."},{"product_id":"1400699894","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I  have had several Nooks in the past. THe nook original and the Nook Color. They each had appeal. The original for the E Ink screen. And the Color for the ability to read in the dark. I heard of the Glolight and I was really hesitant to buy another one. Easily one of the best decisions I ever made. It is super light weight. I just love the backlit screen. I thought it would hurt my eyes like staring at a computer screen too long, but the ability to change the brightness eliminates that. It can go from extremely dim and pleasent to so bright you could use it for a dim flashlight.  All in all WONDERFUL device. I am so please with my purchase. The pages turn fast and seamless, and I have never had an issue with it lagging. It has an excellent WIFI connection. All in all, this is my favore tech device.  Thank you Barnes and Noble for creating the perfect reader. For people debaiting between this and a Kindle, defenitely choose Nook. They give you the ability to lend many titles, you can read any book for fre3e whrn inside a B&N store, great customer service, and a free book every friday. Dont get sucked into the KIndle herd.

Here is a report on what those were, what other uses I discovered, and how Glass fared in regard to each use.<br \/><br \/>A better action video camera?<br \/>I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $50 bullet camera with better battery life, better image quality (because of the wide-angle lense) and better operability (because I see what it records and can pause it etc).<br \/>The verdict: Glass fails in this category. The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger). I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure. This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs. The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.<br \/>It does not fit under or over ski goggles, and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles (too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds).<br \/><br \/>An in-vehicle or dashboard camera?<br \/>A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great. Glass is promising, because it captures my field of view, including the rear view mirror, but it is not reliable and cannot record continuously. When plugged in, the battery life would be no issue, but there is currently no app that records continuously (and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out). Also, the display is always on when it records video, which is bothersome at night.<br \/>With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds, but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.<br \/>My verdict: I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software. Currently it is limited.<br \/><br \/>A better run\/ride tracker?<br \/>I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order, and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.<br \/>The verdict: Glass fails in this category, but my reasoning requires explanation, because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass. Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone, and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired. Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate. When I started a \\\\\"Run\\\\\" on Strava while walking the dog, it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on. I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.<br \/>In addition to issue with GPS accuracy, I don't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat (or rain water!) to enter the device.<br \/><br \/>A better headset?<br \/>A resounding no here. The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear. Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable. The sound quality is moderate at best, and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions, to a point where I cannot understand the other party. I keep my Glass clean and protected, so I am not sure what causes the distortion. Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.<br \/>The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me. Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you can't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket. Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter. I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.<br \/><br \/>A hands-free smart phone controller?<br \/>Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature. If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively, you are being well-served by Glass. You will be alerted by and can read instant messages. and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.<br \/>I don't seem to be able to create emails from scratch, only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts. I do see emails in my Gmail inbox, though. They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass. This is pretty cool.<br \/>The verdict: Unfortunately, I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts, and I frankly don't get Hangouts. I cannot access emails on my company's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass, and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone, I only see 14 contacts on Glass. This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.<br \/><br \/>A better navigation device?<br \/>I really like the way navigation works. I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System. In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all, and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions. This works so much better on Glass.<br \/>My verdict: Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product, in the car as well as on the bike or on foot (even though Google Maps lacks trail data). Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines, it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe. I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn, but I don't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.<br \/><br \/>A better music streaming device?<br \/>With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.<br \/>My verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling\/wiring of ear buds. The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is, well, mono only; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $85, and my ears aren't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway. They tend to hurt and fall out, and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass. Overall, I am somewhat indifferent about Glass' current usefulness as a music streaming device.<br \/><br \/>Other uses?<br \/>Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer. The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited (I just counted 35), which I find surprising, given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.<br \/>My verdict: The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small. I am confident that this will change. Still, no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.<br \/><br \/>A mature and well-tested device?<br \/>I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out. Examples?<br \/>*The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly. I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis. I just disabled this feature entirely.<br \/>*The \\\\\"Ok Glass\\\\\" command stopped working on the 3rd day. I had to do a factory reset to get it back.<br \/>*When I did a factory reset, it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again. Glass would just not get into pairing mode.<br \/>*Currently, phone calls or navigation don't work while on a Wifi connection, even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5. There is no way to \\\\\"disable\\\\\" the wireless connection temporarily. You have to make Glass \\\\\"Forget\\\\\" the connection to make a call and then recreate it. The phone reports the Bluetooth profile \\\\\"Phone Audio\\\\\", not \\\\\"Headset\\\\\" as one would expect.<br \/>*I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass. I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides. So far I added 5 contacts. When I want to make a phone call, I am presented with 14 contact choices, though, the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google. With half of them I have had no contact in years and I don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.<br \/><br \/>My overall verdict:<br \/>The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future. But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline, comes with a high price tag, and that non-techie consumers will struggle with. The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.<br \/>I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month. It still works as a conversation-starter. If you expect anything more than that, you will be disappointed.rough voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.<br \/>My verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling\/wiring of ear buds.

Still awaiting the replacement; hoping to receive it soon because the kids are all out of patience!  One other comment, re. set-up - we have an older TV and the only way I could get it to work was to plug it into the front jacks of my DVD player (which was hooked up to my TV) and then toggle through the various input options until it showed up on the screen - not exactly the simple plug and play I'd hoped for.

My children and I used to go the arcade at the local mall and the DDR machine was one of my personal favorites.  Then the arcade closed for good and I was missing my exercise. Besides, the game was usually already being played so I ended up waiting lots of times.    But this game is terrific and no waiting.  I can turn on my TV and play anytime.  I don't need a game console or any other expensive equipment.  Make sure you wear a pair of socks while playing so your feet don't stick to the pad and don't worry about the smell of the vinyl - it subsides.  A few pieces of duck tape folded so the a sticky surface is exposed on both sides took care of the pad moving on the floor.  I highly recommend this item.

It Stinks! The only thing good about it is that it works. The graphics on the pad is better than the graphics on  T.V. It looks like a Arcade game from the 70's. The graphics are to tell you the truth. Here are some pros and cons about it.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>- The pad is good<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/><br \/>- The graphics are bad<br \/><br \/>- No words in the songs<br \/><br \/>- Sounds like ring tones<br \/><br \/>- about 50 minute long songs<br \/><br \/>- Good for about 5 seconds<br \/><br \/>In the end I only gave it a 3 because it looks good.

It simply was NOT the device that was being shown in the image, but a really crappy knock off that worked maybe half the time with my TV's.  To further complicate things, after contacting the company (A Days Tech), they said they would send me a return envelope (someone also said they had &#34;already sent it&#34;) so I could get a refund.  Well, that never happened.  Then someone duped me (and I fell for it) by asking me to remove my negative feedback and they would send an RMA kit, and refund my money.  I questioned those tactics, but I did it anyway, so that didn't happen either.  Overall, the Amazon reseller (A Days Tech) in my opinion was dishonest about the product listing, the product itself was garbage, and dealing with them via email made them sound more and more shady.  To boot, their page on Amazon seems to incessantly point the finger at Amazon in their feedback section.<br \/><br \/>It seems to me that this Samsung &#34;OEM&#34; HDMI device is not what it appears to be.  I don't know if it's Amazon that is shipping this item, other Amazon retailers, or A Days Tech directly, but either way, for me it was NOT what was shown in the images.  A picture is worth a thousand words, and if the picture says Samsung, and the listing text says &#34;OEM&#34; your natural assumption is that it will say &#34;Samsung&#34; on it when you receive it.

Why RCA changed any specification is a mystery. Everything on the original served a purpose. The reason the brush was black on the original was so that you could see the dust (and it actually grabbed the dust - unlike this model). The red threads under the black top pad was so you could see when it's wearing out. The hole in the handle of the original was to hold the fluid bottle and brush. None of these features have been preserved.<br \/><br \/>[DW]"},{"product_id":"B000000X4N","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I never used the old Discwasher so I simply purchased this hoping to clean up some old LPs and convert them to MP3 files. And I could see the difference after cleaning the LPs according to the directions, and I was able to play the LPs without ruining the needle on the tone arm. But the result was still very scratchy, so there was probably a lot of microscopic dirt still on the records."},{"product_id":"B000000X4N","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I recently revived my old stereo and hundreds of LP albums from the basement. There are many of these albums that never made it to CD, and I also wanted to see what people were talking about when they say that analog vinyl has a warmth that digital CDs do not. Now, a week later, I really do understand.  <br \/> <br \/>But with that warmth comes dust and dirt, which is not a problem for CDs. I remembered that back in the day the standard of excellence for disk cleaning was the Discwasher. I spent about an hour looking for my old one, gave up and bought a new one, now made by RCA.  <br \/> <br \/>The old company either went bankrupt or just sold out, but RCA has run this product into the ground - it's not what you remember. Now made in China, the wood handle is imprecisely cut so that the bottle no longer fits well inside. Instead, it gets lodged and took some time to dislodge. That's not a big issue however, but indicative of how the quality isn't what it used to be.  <br \/> <br \/>The real issue, however, is the cleaning pad. The old model had ridges of material that ran lengthwise to the handle, with the fibers angled so that they dug into the grooves and pulled out the dust, holding onto it. That's why it worked so well. What's the pad covered with now? It appears to be brown corduroy, with ridges, yes, but the fibers have no particular orientation. Thus, it does not dig into the grooves and does an even worse job of holding onto the dirt it does dislodge. I was almost going to give up on the new Discwasher as the results were so second rate.  <br \/> <br \/>I was very disappointed, but thought maybe my memory had built the old Discwasher into something Herculean that didn't match reality. Memory has a way of accentuating either the positives of negatives.  <br \/> <br \/>Well, today I found the old Discwasher, and let me tell you, if anything my memory didn't give the old product enough praise. I have now cleaned several LPs with the old one, and there's an absolute worldof difference. The old one digs the dirt out and keeps it in the pad until you brush it out, completely unlike the one that RCA is peddling these days. The new one leaves a lot of dust on the disc no matter how carefully you roll the brush.  <br \/> <br \/>Shame on you RCA for exploiting and cheapening a venerable old brand. What would it have cost you to put the proper fabric on the pad as opposed to corduroy? Maybe 15 cents per item?? But then again I guess they get the corduroy clippings cheap from a GAP factory in China.  <br \/> <br \/>Yes, it looks like the Discwasher of old, but that's the extent of the resemblance. If you're looking for the Discwasher you remember, look in the basement; maybe you'll get really lucky like I did. Or, look on eBay, but do not look to RCA.  <br \/> <br \/>For those reviewers writing reviews based on the historic quality of this product - you haven't bought this new version. It really is remarkably inferior. <br \/> <br \/>Shame on you RCA for what you've done to this product.  <br \/>"},{"product_id":"B000000X4N","product_category":"Electronics","review_body":"I really miss the hole on the side that the record cleaner would stay in, but I bought a discwasher back in the 80's, and this 2011 version cost less.
